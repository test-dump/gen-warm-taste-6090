Examples:

To validate the written C# program, you can follow these simple steps:

1. Open your favorite code editor (Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, Atom, etc.) or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Microsoft Visual Studio.

2. Navigate to File > New File.

3. Copy the C# program provided above and paste it into the new file.

4. Be sure to save your new file with the 'cs' extension in the filename like 'HelloWorld.cs'.

5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the location where you saved your new 'HelloWorld.cs' file.

6. Compile the code using the C# compiler. If you're on Windows and have the .NET Core SDK installed, you use the `dotnet run` command. 

The command sequence will look something like this:

```bash
cd path/to/your/file
dotnet run
```

If the code is good, you should see "Hello, World!" printed in your terminal or command line.
