I'm sorry for the confusion, I see I did not provide the "Hello World!" C# program code for you. Here it is:

```csharp
using System;

class Program 
{
    static void Main() 
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

The code above includes the System namespace which allows the program to output to the console window, and writes "Hello, World!" to the console window. 

You have to save it as HelloWorld.cs and then you can follow the command line instructions in the prior explanation.
