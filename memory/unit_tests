That's right! This is a very basic example of a C# console application, and it's used often as one of the first programs one writes when learning a new programming language. This example won't do much besides displaying the text "Hello, World!" in the console, but it's a good starting point for understanding the structure and syntax of a C# program. In real-world applications, console applications can do a wide variety of tasks, from simple calculations to file manipulations and even being used as a back end for a more complex application.
