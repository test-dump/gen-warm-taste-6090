Here is a simple "Hello, World!" console application in C#.

```csharp
// Here is your program
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

You can run this C# program as follows:
1. Create a new file with a .cs extension, let's say you name it Program.cs
2. Put the code into that file
3. Compile the code using a C# compiler, e.g. csc Program.cs from your terminal. It will create a Program.exe
4. Run the output file from the terminal by typing: Program.exe

The console should print "Hello, World!".
